              <artifactId>pcap4j-core</artifactId>
              <version>[1.0, 2.0)</version>
            </dependency>
            <dependency>
              <groupId>org.pcap4j</groupId>
              <artifactId>pcap4j-packetfactory-static</artifactId>
              <version>[1.0, 2.0)</version>

==== Testing Instructions ====

1) Except for SpyNeighbors.java, all jobs can be tested directly by running UserInterface.java and
   following the instructions.

3) Each of the 6 jobs have their own specific test case Java files.
4) Each test case saves its output to its own separate TXT file.
5) UserInterface.java also saves its output to a file called outputInterface.txt.
6) FPJobCreator.java saves its output to a file called output.txt.
7) SpyNeighbors.java saves its output to a file called spyOutput.txt.
8) The screenshots of the test case runs are all contained in the folder called "Test Runs".
