All JobSeekers are on the same device, and therefore the same LAN, as the JobCreator.

The JobSeeker has IP Address 192.168.2.18 and MAC Address a0-a8-cd-d6-3c-88

NOTE:	You can only find the MAC Address of the localhost using Java, not those of remote hosts in the same network.
	That means that JobSeeker.java cannot report the MAC addresses of other live hosts sharing its LAN, it can only report their IP addresses.

IP Address 192.168.2.1 is a live host on the same LAN as JobSeeker.
IP Address 192.168.2.11 is a live host on the same LAN as JobSeeker.
